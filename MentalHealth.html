										<br>
										As a group of 5 agile Designers, we created a solution to positively boost post-pandemic mental health. The solution we created received positive testimonials. The design I am displaying on my portfolio is the result of my solo redesign for self-improvement. </font>
									 <br>
								<!-- We  <br>design process and began by building user stories. <br>Then we utilized group ideation techniques such <br> as affinity diagrams, a hierarchical analysis, and<br>  wireframing. We agreed to each tackle a part of <br> the mobile app for optimized efficiency. My contribution <br> (before redesigning the app for self-study and UX practice) was a feature that allowed the user to calm down during anxiety. I went with a meditative interface that features soothing qualities. Upon completion, each of the 5 team members integrated their respective components into a single mobile app. We made sure to communicate frequently to avoid design inconsistencies. The final high-fidelity prototype was accomplished with Figma.-->

												<br>
											
												<font size="+2"> Before designing the solution, we created the following problem scenario to better understand the users we were creating a solution for. My scenario revolved around a girl struggling with mental health during the 2020 pandemic:
													<br>
													<br>
			
			
			
													<font size="+2"><b>Scenario:</b> Depression and Anxiety</font>
													<br>
													<br>
			
													<font size="+2"><b>Actor:</b> Josephine</font>
													<br>
													<br>
			
													<font size="+2"><b>Setting:</b> Josephine's Home</font>
													<br>
													<br>
			
													<font size="+2"><b>Scenario Goal:</b> Managing workload and balancing life while working remotely</font>
													<br>
													<br>
			
													<font size="+2"><b>Scenario Narrative:</b> Josephine is a college freshman that was optimistic yet nervous about starting her first year at college. She was ecstatic to quickly find that she fit right in after the first week of classes and even discovered a group of friends she knew she had a lot in common with. As the semester progressed, Josephine worked dilegently on her classwork and enjoyed her freetime on campus with her friends. One Tuesday in January, Josephine read an email describing the transition to completely remote classes, and that all students were being sent home because of a pandemic. Although Josephine was confused, she wasn't worried because she confidently felt she could tackle anything that came her way. As her semester continued and she became accustomed to the same routine of days full of zoom classes and no inter-personal friendships outside of family, she noticed signs of depression. She also felt more anxiety when it came to her grades as online classes didn't feel the same as in-person classes. Josephine felt like she was sinking, and she reached out to on-campus therapy provided through her university that gave her support as she experienced anxiety and depression. It was through the suggestions of the campus counselors that she took up hobbies to help her unwind such as going on walks outside through nature and puzzle-making.  </font>
