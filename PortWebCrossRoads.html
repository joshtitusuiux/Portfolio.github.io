							<h2>Research Study</h2>  
							<p>	I conducted a study over the course of two weeks to analyze the performance of the Cross Roads Church website I had completed. I asked 25 participants to “speak aloud” as they completed 4 simple tasks on the website through remote and in-person testing. 
								<br> 
								<h3>The Tasks</h3>
								<p>
									- Task 1 was to find the Livestream.
									<br> 
									- Task 2 was to find the donation form.
									<br> 
									- Task 3 was to find the events lists.
									<br> 
									- Task 4 was to find the welcome team sign up form.
									<br> 
									Participants were then asked about their likes and dislikes about the website and provide a rating of the difficulty of each task they completed.
								</p>								
								<h3>The Findings</h3>
								<p>
									The study revealed that the website in its state was easy to use and intuitive for most people, but that there were small areas for improvement. 
								<br> 
								<br>
								There was feedback that the placement of menu options were slightly confusing, and that the live stream was not as easy as it could be for participants to locate. These were minor changes, yet still valid.
								<br>							
							
								<h3>In Conclusion</h3>
								<p>
									The website is performing well and the research definitely supported this. Participants were generally satisfied and had few negative things to say about the website as a whole.
									<br>
